# ROCKY MOUNTAIN WEDDINGS - MEDIA UPDATE GUIDE

This guide will help you update any image or video on the website without having to touch any code. Just follow these simple steps.

## HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

1. Each image or video on the website is stored in a specific folder
2. Each file has a specific name that must be used exactly
3. When you replace these files, the website automatically updates
4. All changes are tracked in a log file

## STEPS TO UPDATE AN IMAGE OR VIDEO

1. Find the image/video you want to replace on the website
2. Look up its name and location in the tables above
3. Create your new image/video in the right dimensions
4. Save it with EXACTLY the same filename (check for typos!)
5. Put it in the correct folder
6. Check the page to see if your update worked

### IMPORTANT TIPS

- Names are case-sensitive (hero.jpg is different from Hero.jpg)
- Don't add extra extensions (.jpg.jpg)
- Use the exact same dimensions as the original image for best results
- JPG format works best for photos
- PNG format works best if you need transparency
- MP4 format works best for videos

## HOW TO DEPLOY YOUR CHANGES

After updating any images or videos, you need to deploy your changes to the live site:

1. Open PowerShell in your project folder (D:\work\rockymountainweddings)
2. Run this command:
   ```
   .\update-site.ps1 -Description "Updated [what you changed]" -Version "2.0.2"
   ```
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for the site to update
4. Refresh your browser (press Ctrl+F5) to see your changes

## CHECKING IF YOUR UPDATE WORKED

1. All media updates are logged in this file: `src/assets/media-updates.log`
2. Check this file to see if your update was recorded
3. If your update isn't showing on the website:
   - Make sure the filename is exactly correct
   - Check that you put it in the right folder
   - Try clearing your browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
   - Try deploying again

## NEED HELP?

If you're still having trouble updating media:
1. Double-check the filename and location
2. Check the size of your image (too large may cause issues)
3. Try a different image format
4. Try running the site locally using `dev-server.bat` to test changes
