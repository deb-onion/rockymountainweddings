# ROCKY MOUNTAIN WEDDINGS - MEDIA UPDATE GUIDE

This guide will help you update any image or video on the website without having to touch any code. Just follow these simple steps.

## HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

1. Each image or video on the website is stored in a specific folder
2. Each file has a specific name that must be used exactly
3. When you replace these files, the website automatically updates
4. All changes are tracked in a log file

## IMPORTANT UPDATE: FILE PLACEMENT

**IMPORTANT:** All image and video files must be placed directly in the main image or video folders, NOT in subfolders:
- All images go directly in: `src/assets/images/`
- All videos go directly in: `src/assets/videos/`

The website code is looking for files in these main folders, not in subfolders.

## STEPS TO UPDATE AN IMAGE OR VIDEO

1. Find the image/video you want to replace on the website
2. Find its exact filename in the tables above
3. Create your new image/video in the right dimensions
4. Save it with EXACTLY the same filename (check for typos!)
5. Place it directly in the main folders (src/assets/images/ or src/assets/videos/)
6. Deploy the changes (see instructions below)
7. Check the page to see if your update worked

### IMPORTANT TIPS

- Names are case-sensitive (hero.jpg is different from Hero.jpg)
- Don't add extra extensions (.jpg.jpg)
- Use the exact same dimensions as the original image for best results
- JPG format works best for photos
- PNG format works best if you need transparency
- MP4 format works best for videos
- DO NOT place files in subfolders - put them directly in the main folders
- To find what an image is called, right-click on it in your browser and select "Inspect" to see its filename

## HOW TO DEPLOY YOUR CHANGES

After updating any images or videos, you need to deploy your changes to the live site:

1. Open PowerShell in your project folder (D:\work\rockymountainweddings)
2. Run this command:
   ```
   .\update-site.ps1 -Description "Updated [what you changed]" -Version "2.0.2"
   ```
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for the site to update
4. Refresh your browser (press Ctrl+F5) to see your changes

## CHECKING IF YOUR UPDATE WORKED

1. All media updates are logged in this file: `src/assets/media-updates.log`
2. Check this file to see if your update was recorded
3. If your update isn't showing on the website:
   - Make sure the filename is exactly correct
   - Check that you put it directly in the main folder (not in a subfolder)
   - Try clearing your browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
   - Try deploying again

## NEED HELP?

If you're still having trouble updating media:
1. Double-check the filename and location
2. Check the size of your image (too large may cause issues)
3. Try a different image format
4. Try running the site locally using `dev-server.bat` to test changes
5. Right-click on the image on the website and select "Inspect" to confirm the exact filename being used
