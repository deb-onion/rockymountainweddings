DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

To get your updated image to show on the live site, you need to deploy the changes. 
Here are the steps to follow:

OPTION 1: Using the update-site.ps1 script
------------------------------------------
1. Open a PowerShell window in your project directory (D:\work\rockymountainweddings)
2. Run this command:
   .\update-site.ps1 -Description "Updated service-intro.jpg image" -Version "2.0.1"

OPTION 2: Using Git commands directly
-------------------------------------
1. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window in your project directory
2. Run these commands:
   git add src/assets/images/service-intro.jpg
   git commit -m "Updated service-intro.jpg image"
   git push

OPTION 3: Using GitHub Desktop or another Git client
----------------------------------------------------
1. Open your Git client
2. Stage the changed file (src/assets/images/service-intro.jpg)
3. Commit with a message like "Updated service-intro.jpg image"
4. Push to your GitHub repository

After Deployment
---------------
Once you've pushed the changes to GitHub:
1. Cloudflare Pages will automatically start a new deployment
2. This typically takes 1-2 minutes
3. Once complete, your new image will appear on the live site
4. You may need to hard-refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) to see the changes

To check deployment status:
1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Look for the latest deployment
3. Wait for it to show "Success"
